# Data Science 
## FIFA dataset<br>
  Created and visualized a data frame which tells us the which player are most undervalued , so that they can be bought with minimal value when the transfer market opens.<br>
# Machine Learning<br>
## Iris dataset<br>
  Created a Machine Learning model that can detect types of the Iris flower.<br>
  <br>
  Libraries used:<br>
<b>Numpy - It's a library that helps us to use lists and arrays and python and specifically multi-dimensional arrays<br>
<b>Pandas - It gives us an idea of this data frame which allows us the functionality to manipulate data in tabular structure with rows and columns.
<b> Matplotlib - Allows us to visualize the data  <br>  
  scikit-learn - Used to access the iris dataset, classify,regress and used the algorithm: K Nearest Neighbour for the model creation
